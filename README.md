# Start pug

## Overview 

This is a very simple starter kit for development on [Pug](https://pugjs.org) template engine that uses the [gulp](https://gulpjs.com) task runner to transform pug files.

## Quickstart

### Choose your preferred option:

- You can immediately download the [zip](https://github.com/RinatValiullov/start-pug/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) files.

- Or you can create a repository from this template. Find in the right top corner the button `Use this template` and press it. Then you can choose your own repo name, description and other functions:

<img src="use-template.jpg" alt="use this template button">

- Or you can clone this repository:

1. Paste this command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/RinatValiullov/start-pug.git my-app
```

2. Go to `my-app` directory:

```
cd my-app
```

3. Install all required development dependencies via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started):

```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```

4. Start the project:

```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

5. For more convenient development go to your favorite code editor or IDE.
